# Pyro models for SARS-CoV-2 analysis

This repository is described in the paper ["Analysis of 2.1 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes identifies mutations associated with transmissibility"](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.07.21263228v1). Figures and supplementary data for that paper are in the [paper/](paper/) directory.

## Reproducing

### Install software

Clone this repository:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:broadinstitute/pyro-cov
cd pyro-cov
```

Install nextclade, depending on your platform:
```sh
make install-nextalign-linux
make install-nextclade-linux
```
or 
```sh
make install-nextalign
make install-nextclade
```
or
```sh
conda install nodejs
npm install --global @nextstrain/nextclade
```

Install this python package:
```py
pip install -e .
```

### Get access to GISAID data

Work with GISAID to get a data agreement.
Define the following environment variables:
```
GISAID_USERNAME
GISAID_PASSWORD
GISAID_FEED
```
For example my username is `fritz` and my gisaid feed is `broad2`.

### Download data
This downloads data from GISAID and clones repos for other data sources.
```sh
make update 
```

### Preprocess data

This can takes 20-40 hours on a 60-core machine.
Results are cached in the `results/` directory, so re-running on newly pulled data should be able to re-use alignment and PANGOlineage classification work.
```sh
make preprocess
```

### Analyze data
```sh
python mutrans.py --vary-holdout 
python mutrans.py --vary-gene
python mutrans.py --vary-nsp
python mutrans.py --vary-leaves=9999
./run_backtesting.sh
```

### Generate plots and tables
Plots and tables are generated by running various notebooks:
- [mutrans.py](notebooks/mutrans.py)
- [mutrans_backtesting.py](mutrans_backtesting.ipynb)
- [mutrans_gene.ipynb](notebooks/mutrans_gene.ipynb)
